🍂 Stepper was not yet added to server-builder.tsx. There is no Dockerfile in the project, so Docker cannot initialize the app. 

Actions taken:
- Created a production Dockerfile suitable for Next.js + shadcn + Tailwind + Typescript.
- Will add Stepper to the top of ServerBuilder and wire it to the build/generate flow.

Stepper steps: Describe → Generate → Review → Deploy. Will increment step on generate, and allow for future step control.

Next: Implement these changes in server-builder.tsx (import Stepper, add state, render at top, wire to generate button).
