# MCP Server CORS Issue Debugging

## Problem
- Encountered CORS error when attempting to build an MCP server
- Error occurs when making direct browser fetch to Gemini API
- Error message: "Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/models/gemini/2.5-pro-exp-03-25:generateContent"

## First Solution Attempt (CORS Proxy)
1. Created a server-side API proxy route:
   - Added new route at `/src/app/api/gemini/route.ts`
   - This route forwards requests to Gemini API from the server side, avoiding CORS restrictions

2. Modified the client-side code:
   - Updated `generateMCPTools` function in `/src/lib/api/mcp.ts` to use our proxy endpoint
   - Instead of calling Gemini API directly, it now calls our `/api/gemini` endpoint

## New Errors
- After implementing the proxy, received a 404 error:
  - "Error: Failed to generate tools: 404 - "
  - The issue was with URL construction in the proxy
  - First fixed by properly formatting the model name

## Improved Solution
1. Enhanced the proxy implementation:
   - Fixed URL construction to properly handle different model name formats
   - Added detailed logging for better debugging
   - Improved error handling with proper status codes
   - Added validation for required parameters

2. Updated client-side code:
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - Fixed type errors in the code
   - Streamlined the API request process

3. Key fixes:
   - The URL structure needed to include "models/" prefix correctly
   - Fixed how we parse "gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25" to "models/gemini/2.5-pro-exp-03-25"
   - Added more detailed error messages to help with debugging
   - Fixed syntax errors caused by our changes
   - Solved type issues with proper TypeScript type annotations

## Implementation Details
- Next.js API route handles the actual Gemini API call server-side
- Client sends the same parameters but to our local API endpoint
- Credentials and API keys are handled server-side, improving security
- Added more robust error handling throughout the process
- Enhanced logging to track request/response flow

## Common Issues to Check
- Make sure the API key is correctly set in environment variables
- Verify the server is running when testing the API call
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Make sure the model name format is correct when making requests

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Add caching to reduce duplicate requests
- Implement better error handling and user feedback
- Add detailed logging for errors
- Add unit tests to verify API calls work correctly
